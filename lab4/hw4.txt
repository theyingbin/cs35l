I started by making a new branch named quote. This was done using:
     git checkout v3.0 -b quote
I needed to apply the patch I made in the lab. This was done using:
     patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
I now need to make a Changelog file. I did this by opening up emacs and used
the add-change-log-entry-other-window command (C-x 4 a). I referred back to
git status in the shell to see which files were changed so I can describe the
changes.
After finishing Changelog, I needed to commit the changes while using
Changelog as my message. This was done using:
     git add .
     git commit -F Changelog
In order to create and store a formatted patch file, I used the command:
     git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
I then emailed my patch to my partner, Menglin Ruan, and got a copy of her
patch. To verify that Menglin's patch worked, I checked v3.0 again and applied
her patch using the following commands:
     git checkout -b partner
     git am < formatted-patch.txt
I then setup the system using:
     ./bootstrap
     ./configure
     make
     make check
In order to verify that commit message was added, I ran the following commands:
     make distdir
     emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog
In order to run gitk, I needed the emacs repository. I got it using:
     git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
After installing X11, I had to restart my session of putty and enable X11
forwarding. After I did this setup, I was able to run gitk in the emacs
repository that I cloned earlier.
