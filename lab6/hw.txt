1. If the other team has been observing all the bytes going across the network,
   my resulting network is still secure because the bytes sent across are
   encrypted.

   If the other team has tapped into my keyboard and observed all my
   keystrokes, then our data would still be secure assuming that we don't
   type any important data, such as passwords, across the network. For example,
   if we login using keys, the other team won't be able to get any information
   when I send files since I would be using public keys to encrypt data.

   If the other team had physical control of the USB I'm booting off of then
   they have access to our private key. They can use our private key to decrypt
   anything that is sent to us. Our team's weakness was allowing them access to
   the USB that we boot off of.

2. gpg --verify does not verify the identity of the person who sent the file
   versus the signature of the person. An attacker can easily take somebody
   else's public key and add their signature. To fix this problem, we need a
   third party, or Certificate Authority, to prove that the person who sent
   the file is who they claim to be.
