For this lab, I had to first install OpenSSH for both the server and client.
This was done using the following commands:
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install openssh-server
     sudo apt-get install openssh-client

I need to set up a server for my lab partner. I did this by using the commands:
     sudo useradd -d /home/menglin -m Menglin
     sudo passwd Menglin

After I entered a password, I moved into the new directory I just made and
did the following commands:
     sudo mkdir .ssh
     sudo chown -R Menglin .ssh
     sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I used the following command to find the IP address for my partner to ssh 
into my server:
     ifconfig

In order to confirm that I made a server for my partner, I used the command:
     ps aux | grep ssh
I confirm I made a server for my partner because the output shows a process
named sshd

Before trying to log onto the server my partner made for me, I check my
connection with it using the following command:
     ping 128.97.51.51

Once I confirm that I'm connected, I ssh into my partner's server by using:
     ssh ying@128.97.51.51
Doing it this way prompts me to enter a password.

Now we will try to log into the server without a password. To do this, I first 
create a key to store in the server
     ssh-keygen

Next, I will register my key with the server
     ssh-copy-id -i ying@128.97.51.51
Initially, this will ask for a password so I can register my key with the server

Now when I try to ssh into the server, I will not be asked for a password
     ssh ying@128.97.51.51

Now I will attempt to do a passphrase-less login. This is done using the 
following commands:
     ssh-add
This asks me for my passphrase for my key I generated

I can confirm this works by attempting to ssh into the server
     ssh ying@128.97.51.51

In order to get port forwarding to work, I simply ssh with the -X flag
     ssh -X ying@128.97.51.51

To test that this works, I used the following commands:
     xterm
     firefox
I confirmed that these processes involving a GUI work.
