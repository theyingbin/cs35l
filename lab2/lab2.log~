1. sort < /usr/share/dict/words > words
This sorts the contents of /usr/share/dict/words and puts the results into words

2. wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
This downloads the HTML source code for the assignment 2 page

3. cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This translates any character not in the alphabet into a newline character

4. cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This does the same thing as before except it squeezes all characters not in the
alphabet into a single newline character

5. cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
This does the same thing as before except it now sorts the output based on
the ASCII code for each character

6. cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
This does the same thing as before except it gets rid of duplicates

7. cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
This compares the words of assign2.html to the words in the file "words"
The first column shows the words unique to assign2.html
The second column shows the words unique to the file "words"
The third column shows words in both assign2.html and the file "words"

8. cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
This does the same thing as above except it omits the second and third column

!/bin/bash

sed '/<!DOCTYPE/,/Adopt/d' |
sed '/<\/table/,/<\/html>/d' |
sed '/<tr>/,/<\/td>/d' |
grep '<td>.*<\/td>' |
sed 's/([^)]*)//' |
sed 's/`/'"'"'/g' |
sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' |
tr "[:blank:]|," "\n" |
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
sort -u

10. To find the misspelled hawaiian words given hwords, I used
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' |
sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc
Using this, I found 405 misspelled hawaiian words

Using the command in answer #8, I found there to be 80 misspelled English words
