I compared the runtime differences between my sfrob, sfrobu, and sfrobs using the time command. 

10 spaces:

   sfrob
   real    0m0.003s
   user    0m0.000s
   sys     0m0.002s

   sfrobu
   Comparisons: 24
   real    0m0.002s
   user    0m0.000s
   sys     0m0.002s

   sfrobs
   real    0m0.005s
   user    0m0.003s
   sys     0m0.005s

   We can see for small files, that the runtimes are all comparable

500000 spaces:

   sfrob
   real    0m1.447s
   user    0m0.491s
   sys     0m0.058s

   sfrobu
   Comparisons: 4692521
   real    0m5.821s
   user    0m0.704s
   sys     0m5.102s

   sfrobs
   real    0m1.061s
   user    0m0.131s
   sys     0m0.076s

   We can see that for big files, sfrobu is significantly slower than sfrobs and sfrob

My estimate for the number of comparisons as a function of spaces is n*log(n) comparisons for n spaces

Number of spaces            Comparisons
10			    24
100                         569
1000                        9080
10000                       125574
100000                      1602111

This table shows that sfrobu roughly has n*log(n) compaisons as expected of a quicksort function
