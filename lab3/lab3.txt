We must first grab the original Coreutils 7.6 using the following command:
   wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
Since we downloaded a tar.gz file, we must extract the contents. This is done
using the following command
   tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
In the coreutils-7.6 file and I can run configure which will create the makefile
   ./configure
Now that the make file exists, I can run make, which will create object
files in src and install the changes into the machine
   make
   make install
I noticed that there are error messages since I do not have root permission
I look at the INSTALL file and notice that the prefix option allows me to
specify the path I want to install in. This was done using the commands below
   ./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/yingw/cs35l/lab3/
   make
   make install
In order to reproduce the bug on my machine, I go into the folder in which
ls was installed into
   cd ~/cs35l/lab3/bin
   ./ls -l /bin/bash
I can clearly see that the date is not in Unix format
Now to fix the bug, we must change the source code of the ls.c file
in the coreutils-7.6 src directory
The changes are given in the following website:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html
With the new changes, we have to call make again in the top level of our source
tree so it creates a new object file and executable corresponding to the changes

Upon calling make, the only commands that do anything are the ones below
  CC     ls.o    # New object file created
  CCLD   dir	 # Recompiled dir
  CCLD   vdir	 # Recompiled vdir
  CCLD   ls	 # Recompiled ls
The other commands just enter and leave directories. The new object file needed
to be created since we changed the source code of ls.c. The executables needed
to be recompiled because they probably have dependencies on ls.o

In order to test the modified ls, I made two new files, one that is over a year
old and one that was made recently. I did the following command to do this
  touch foobar
  touch --date="2015-01-01 00:00:00" hello
I then ran the modified ls to verify that the date format is in traditional
Unix format
