Q1. Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it was
    simply messy code. It was a fall through case in a switch statement and is
    not required to change the date format into traditional Unix format.

Q2. This may cause some problems for people in other countries if they don't
    speak English because they may not recognize the format and would need to
    get accustomed to it. I would need to watch out for programs that would
    expect another kind of date format as it would be a potential source of
    bugs if our program expects a different kind of input.

Q3. Since the file is empty, the "self.lines" variable in the randline class
    containing a list of the lines is empty. When we attempt to call
    random.choice from the random library, python gives us an IndexError

Q4. When we run randline.py with python3, we get a SyntaxError. This is
    because of the syntax difference between the two python interpreters.
    This error occurs on line 65
    	 except IOError as (errno, strerror):
    This is because tuple unpackking has been removed in python3 because of
    the problems it has caused
