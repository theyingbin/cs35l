1. I used 'man man' to look at the man page for the man command
   I found that the -k flag allows me to specify a word to look for in the man
   pages and prints out the command the specified word describes
2. I used the 'which' command to look at where 'cp' and 'wc' are in the file
   system. I found that 'cp' is located in /usr/local/cs/bin/cp and 'wc' is
   located in /usr/local/cs/bin/wc
3. I first looked at my path environment variable to see where the shell looks
   for commands using 'echo $PATH'. Since this prints out a list of directories,
   I searched these directories for one word executables using the command
   'find [path] -executable -name ?' where I simply replace '[path]' for a
   directory found in my path environment variable. I found the one word
   executables to be the following:
   /usr/local/cs/bin/[
   /usr/bin/w
   /usr/bin/[
   /usr/bin/X
   The command w shows who is logged in and what they are doing
   The command X launches a portable, network-transparent window system
   The command [ is a built-in symbol in bash
4. To find out the file that is actually executed when I use the command
   /usr/bin/emacs, I used the 'readlink' command. I kept using readlink
   on the output of the previous command until the shell didn't print
   anything, indicating that we found the executable. I found that the
   command that is actually executed is /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
5. In order to find out what 'g+s' and 'o-x' means, I looked in the man page
   for chmod. I found out that 'g+s' turns the setgid bit on, which allows
   the group to run the executable with the owner's permission. Also 'o-x'
   sets the executable bit for others off, meaning people that are not in
   your group cannot run the executable.
6. I looked in the man pages for find and found that the -mtime option allows
   me to see which files have been modified. I found the files which have been
   modified in the last 3 weeks using the command 'find -mtime 21'
7. In order to find all the directories that have been modified within the last
   3 weeks, I used the command 'find / -mtime 21 -type d' to find all
   directories from the root.
8. To find the directory that find is in, I used which find and found it to be
   in /usr/bin. I found the number of symbolic links in this directory by using
   the command 'find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l' and got the answer 287
9. In order to find the oldest file, I used the command 'ls /usr/lib -lt' and
   looked at the file on the bottom. I found that the oldest file is
   'libfreeblpriv3.so' and was last modified on Aug  7 13:43.
10. I looked into the man pages for locale and found that it gets its data
    from the LC_* variables
11. To look for the emacs commands that have sort in their name, I opened
    emacs and used the command 'C-h a sort' and got the following list:
    Buffer-menu-sort
    sort-columns
    sort-fields
    sort-lines
    sort-numeric-fields
    sort-pages
    sort-paragraphs
    sort-regexp-fields
    tabulated-list-col-sort
    tabulated-list-sort
12. To find a list of commands, I used the command 'C-h b'
    C-M-a beginning-of-defun
    C-M-b backward-sexp
    C-M-c exit-recursive-edit
    C-M-d down-list
    C-M-e end-of-defun
    C-M-f forward-sexp
    C-M-g This command does not exist
    C-M-h mark-defun
13. C-g will cancel the current partially typed or executing command
14. The yank function reinserts the last stretch of killed text
15. In order to see the output of the dired command in Emacs, I used the
    keystrokes 'C-x d /usr/bin'. From inspection I can see that the dired
    command shows some hidden files that ls -l doesn't. It also shows the
    files '.' and '..'
